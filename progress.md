# Progress

## Current verified state (2026-08-17 — HOLD POINT: all automatable work done)

Suite: **422 passed / 30 skipped / 0 failed**; ruff + mypy strict green.
SDD ledger: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-16-reachy-mini-poc/progress.md`.

Tasks complete through implementer → review → fix rounds → re-review:
1 (scaffold, mcp<2, green baseline), 2 (dev daemon on :8001), 3 (recovered-
handler study), 4 (resample helper), 5 (OpenAIRealtimeHandler on
gpt-realtime-2.1 + soxr streaming + tunable VAD), 6 (wiring +
tracking-on-startup + zh), 7 (Chinese locked profile), 8-automated (LIVE
session verified: 234 ms response, ~1 s first audio, RPC say/interrupt,
VoiceFX active), 9+10+11-automated (emotion→dance3 chain, camera→input_image
accepted by the model, auto web-search with real zh results; US-02
dev-verified), 12-unit (MCP seam, bounded discovery), 13-unit (home_control
with HA_ENTITIES allowlist), 14 (adding-a-skill guide, skeleton executed),
16 (VoiceFX engine-free chipmunk+ringmod, Codex-reviewed amendment).

Robot deployment (Task 15 prep): robot OFFLINE at attempt 1 — nothing
touched; wheel built and verified pure; all 43 deps wheel-resolve for
aarch64; deploy procedure corrected from SDK source (D-009: version route =
`/update/install-source`, `--no-deps` two-step install, `.env` wiped on every
reinstall, version gate is decisive because the daemon force-syncs apps_venv).

## Known defects / open decisions

- BUG (tracked in DEMO-1 next): RPC/UI stop button clears the queue but
  never sends `response.cancel` — playback resumes. Voice barge-in is the
  separate server-side path (expected working; operator confirms).
- Demo behavior call needed: "恭喜我吧" → SILENT 18.4 s dance
  (play_emotion needs_response=False). Cute or confusing? Operator decides.
- Dev-box only: mockup-sim picks the IR camera (black frames) and its face
  endpoint is structurally dead — vision/face rehearsals need the robot.
- T11 latency: 16.8 s to spoken answer; 4.5 s is per-call MCP session setup
  (session-reuse opportunity, deferred).

## Waiting on operator

1. Mic pass (2 min): Chinese multi-turn, voice barge-in, ~1 s pause,
   VoiceFX ear-tuning (`scripts\dev_daemon.ps1` + `scripts\run_app_dev.ps1`).
2. Robot power-on → resume `reachy-deploy` at Step 1 (procedure corrected).
3. Notion MCP + Home Assistant credentials → Tasks 12.5 / 13.5.

## Next after operator items

Final whole-branch review (most capable model, per SDD) → Task 15 on-robot
five-demo gate → close feature_list with evidence.
